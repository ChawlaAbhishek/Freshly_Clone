Project: make a clone of https://www.freshly.com/ site

*Freshly is a website that provides fresh food delivery service in USA...*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#160;In this project we have tried to make a look alike clone of freshly.com website. With our efforts and the technology stack, that we have learned till now in Unit-2 in the masai school, we were able to clone the front end with same looking & features.



## Technology Stack Used

- #### Languages
  - `HTML`
  - `CSS`
  - `Javascript`

### End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we were tried to achieve a near to perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of javascript, css, HTML and local databases. This entire journey of has given us experiences and we have learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence. If we have more time we can able to add more products.

### Limitations:
All pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.
(Recomended Resolution: 1366 x 768 )
